--------------- DESCRIPTION ------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________


A high res table soccer. It's textured and fully functional with rotations and translations set up correctly, and I 
also set up limits for the bars and the scoring units, so it's ready to use, whether you want to use it for 
animation or as a prop, to fill or decorate an area for render.

--------------- System requirements-----------------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________


This product was created in Maya 2012 on a PC. It was not tested on other Version of Maya or on a MAC system. 
The POSER version of this product was created with Poser Pro 2012. it was not tested on an other version of Poser or Daz studio.

--------------- Installation Instructions ----------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________


I placed all the files in the root folder, so you shouldn't get any problem loading the textures, with any 3D application. Just open the Maya files (.ma or .mb) or import the file format you like in an already exesting scene. You may need to adjuste the size of the model. 

Unfortunatly, with the obj format, you loose the limits set up. Also, all the pivot points move to the center of the scene so you will have to put them back in place if you want to animate the model. 
    
For the poser version, you can directly open the pz3 file or place the content of the "POSERversion" folder in your Poser Runtime and load the Jetbike from Library. To do that, Copy the Runtime folder and paste it into your Poser directory. Every file should go to the right place.
