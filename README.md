TO BE FIXED: Red Attack rod isn't repsonding to translation or rotation.
To BE ADDED: Background image.
NOTES:
1- The main script file which controllers the rods and the ball is "testing\Assets\Scripts\Controller.cs", 
you can also access it from the Main Camera inspector in unity
2- There are 2 small scripts for the score text, 
you can access them Canvas inspector in unity or you can find them in the same directory as Controller.cs.
